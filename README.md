# Go File Execution Guide

This guide will help you run Go files in your local environment.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Running Go Files

**Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

cd <repository-directory>

```bash
go run <filename.go>
```

Replace <filename.go> with the name of the Go file you want to run.

# Additional Notes

- If your Go file has dependencies, you may need to install them using go get before running the file.
- Some files may require additional setup or configuration. Refer to the file's documentation or comments for more information.

## Example

Suppose you have a Go file named hello.go that prints "Hello, World!". You can run it as follows:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

You should see the output:
```bash
Hello, World!
```
